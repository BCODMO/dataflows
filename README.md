# ![logo](logo-s.png) DataFlows

DataFlows is a novel and intuitive way of building data processing flows.

- It's built for medium-data processing - data that fits on your hard drive, but is too big to load in Excel or as-is into Python, and not big enough to require spinning up a Hadoop cluster...
- It's built upon the foundation of the Frictionless Data project - which means that all data prduced by these flows is easily reusable by others.

## QuickStart 

Install `dataflows` via `pip install.`

Then use the command-line interface to bootstrap a basic processing script based on your needs:

```bash

$ pip install dataflows

$ dataflows
Hi There!
DataFlows will now bootstrap a data processing flow based on your needs.
